# Recursion to generate Fibonacci Series
Generating the first 'n' terms of the Fibonacci series using the process of Recursion. The goal of this program is to further comprehend the complex process of Recursion in python.

In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science
